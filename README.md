# Salve

A KISS-ier, concurrent by default Scala wrapper of [Clarity](http://github.com/skadistats/clarity)

## Usage

Salve is still a new project, many things are missing (actually, only an interface to dota_combatlog is avalaible atm).

If you **really really** want to use it, you have to download the source and compile it by yourself, docs are also coming.

## YOUR CODE IS UGLY/YOU DID IT WRONG

Sorry about that, I am new to scala (like seriously new) so this has to be expected, open an issue or email me to stoke95@gmail.com and I will be very happy to listen to your complaints

## Do you need help?

Definitely, and a lot of it. If you want to add a feature: submit a pull request with the code and a test, and i'll offer you a beer. Seriously, i'll do it.


## Tests

`sbt test`

Tests are currently written with ScalaTest using the FlatSpec spec
